## Indicator Functionality

The Abiroid Slope MA indicator calculates the slope of a moving average to identify trends in the market. It uses the following parameters and calculations:

1. Moving Average Slope for Max Past Bars:
   - `pastBars`: Set the number of past bars to monitor.
   - `maValue`: Calculate the moving average value.
   - `slope`: Calculate the slope value based on the difference between the current moving average value and the moving average value `pastBars` bars ago.

2. Slope Period:
   - `period`: Set the number of periods for slope calculation.
   - `slopeValue`: Calculate the slope value based on the difference between the current moving average value and the moving average value `period` bars ago.

3. Slope Thresholds:
   - `threshold`: Set the slope threshold value.
   - If `slope` is above the threshold, it indicates an upward trend. Appropriate actions like placing a buy trade can be taken.
   - If `slope` is below the negative threshold, it indicates a downward trend. Appropriate actions like placing a sell trade can be taken.

## Usage

To use the Abiroid Slope MA indicator, follow these steps:

1. Install the indicator in your MetaTrader platform.
2. Apply the indicator to the desired chart.
3. Configure the parameters `pastBars`, `period`, and `threshold` according to your preference.
4. Monitor the indicator's slope values to identify trends.
5. Take appropriate trading actions based on the slope values and thresholds.
